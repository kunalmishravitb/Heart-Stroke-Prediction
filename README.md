# 🫀 Heart Stroke Prediction

### Problem Statement and Solution Proposed 

This project aims to solve the problem of Healthcare clinics where they can predict if a patient is likely to get heart stroke based on diagnostic report, the model is done Using Sklearn's supervised machine learning techniques. It is a Classification problem and training are carried out on dataset of previous patients with their diagnostic report with age, gender and history of other disease. Several classification techniques have been studied, the model has been finalized with Random forest and K-Nearest Neighbors in pipeline.

For Detailed EDA and Feature engineering Check out notebook directory. dataset is stored locally inside notebooks directory.

Their performances were compared in order to determine which one works best with our dataset and used them to predict if patient will get heart stroke or not from user input from Flask application.

## How to run?
Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage. You also need AWS account to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.

## Models Used 
- Logistic Regression
- KNeighbors Classifier
- XGB Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- SVC
- AdaBoost Classifier
- RandomForest Classifier

From these above models after hyperparameter optimization we selected Top two models which were KNeighbors Classifier and Random Forest Classifier and used the following in Pipeline.

GridSearchCV is used for Hyperparameter Optimization in the pipeline.

heart_stroke is the main package folder which contains all codes.


#### Conclusion 
- This Project can be used in real-life by Health Clinics to predict if the user has chance of heart stroke or not.
- Can be implemented in hospital website to predict the chance of heart stroke for the patients.
- As heart diseases and strokes are increasing rapidly across the world and causing deaths, it becomes necessary to develop an efficient system that would predict the heart stroke effectively before hand so that immediate medical attention can be given. In the proposed system, the most effective algorithm for stroke prediction was obtained after comparative analysis of the accuracy scores of various models.
